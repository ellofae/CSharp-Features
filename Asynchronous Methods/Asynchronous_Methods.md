<h5>Asynchronous Methods</h5>
<span>Asynchronous methods perform work in the background and notify you when they are complete, allowing
your code to take care of other business while the background work is performed. Asynchronous methods
are an important tool in removing bottlenecks from code and allow applications to take advantage of
multiple processors and processor cores to perform work in parallel.</span>

<div class="pt-5 mt-5"><span>In ASP.NET Core, asynchronous methods can be used to improve the overall performance of an
application by allowing the server more flexibility in the way that requests are scheduled and executed. Two
C# keywords—async and await—are used to perform work asynchronously.</span></div>
