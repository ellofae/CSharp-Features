<h5>Asynchronous Methods</h5>
<span>Asynchronous methods perform work in the background and notify you when they are complete, allowing
your code to take care of other business while the background work is performed. Asynchronous methods
are an important tool in removing bottlenecks from code and allow applications to take advantage of
multiple processors and processor cores to perform work in parallel.</span>
